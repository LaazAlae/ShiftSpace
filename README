Additional Feature: Theme Persistence & Synchronization

Feature Description
I implemented a synchronized dark/light mode theme system that:
- Persists user theme preferences in the database
- Synchronizes theme across all pages
- Defaults to dark mode for new users
- Maintains consistency during navigation and page refreshes

This feature enhances user experience by:
1. Saving user preferences permanently (not just in local storage)
2. Providing consistent visuals across the entire application
3. Respecting user preferences across different devices and sessions
4. Offering an accessible interface for different lighting conditions
5. Maintaining theme state during all user interactions

This feature goes beyond any existing project requirements by:
Creating a system-wide visual state management that wasn't covered in any UI/UX requirements
Adding accessibility considerations
Creating a default state system with override capabilities
Adding user customization features that extend beyond the basic profile and authentication systems previously required

Testing Procedure

Initial Setup
1. Create a new account or log in to an existing account
2. Note the default dark theme

Theme Toggle Test
1. Click the light mode toggle button (sun icon) in the sidebar
2. Verify the interface changes to light mode
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify light mode persists after refresh

Multi-Page Consistency Test
1. While in light mode, navigate to your profile page
2. Verify the profile page loads in light mode
4. Return to the home page
3. Toggle back to dark mode
5. navigate to your profile page
6. Verify the profile page loads in dark mode



### Persistence Test
1. Set your preferred theme
2. Log out of your account
3. Log back in
4. Verify your theme preference is restored

### Default State Test
1. Create a new account
2. Verify the default dark theme is applied
3. Change to light theme
4. Log out and back in
5. Verify light theme preference is maintained

All tests should pass with immediate visual feedback and no page reloads required for theme changes.
